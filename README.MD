Blood Bank Management System 

Project Overview

The Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline and automate the critical operations of a modern blood bank. This project addresses the core challenges faced by blood centers, such as inefficient record-keeping, difficulty in matching donors to recipients, and manual tracking of blood stock.

By providing a centralized digital platform, BBMS ensures the reliable and secure management of donor information, blood inventory, cross-matching processes, and camp scheduling, ultimately improving operational efficiency and enhancing timely service to hospitals and patients.

This system demonstrates the application of [Insert Subject-Specific Concept Here, e.g., CRUD operations, database normalization, or MVC architecture] learned in the course.

Features

The system is organized into three major functional modules:

1. Donor Management Module

Registration: Securely register new donors and store their demographic and medical history.

Eligibility Screening: Automatically check and flag donor eligibility based on predefined criteria (age, recent donation date, disease markers).

Donation History: Maintain a detailed record of all past donations by a donor.

2. Inventory Management Module

Blood Stock Tracking: Real-time visibility into the availability of blood units, categorized by blood group (A+, O-, AB+, etc.), component type (Whole Blood, Plasma, Platelets), and expiry date.

Unit Processing: Record details of collected units, including testing results, processing date, and storage location.

Expiry Alerts: Automated alerts for units nearing their expiration date.

3. Hospital/Request Management Module

Request Handling: Log and manage blood requests from affiliated hospitals, specifying required blood group and quantity.

Cross-Matching: Efficiently search and match available units to outstanding requests based on compatibility.

Reporting & Analytics: Generate critical reports on current stock levels, monthly donation statistics, and most requested blood groups.

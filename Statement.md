problem statement

The existing manual process for tracking and managing employee training certifications within a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) is inefficient, prone to data entry errors, and often leads to non-compliance when certification expiry dates are missed. A centralized, automated system is needed to reliably track certificate statuses, send timely renewal alerts, and provide management with a compliance overview.

scope of project

The project will focus on the development of a web-based Certificate Management System (CMS). It will include user authentication for employees and administrators, a database for storing certificate records, a mechanism for uploading digital copies, and an automated notification system for upcoming expirations. The scope does not include integrating with external HR or payroll systems, nor does it include a mobile application interface.

target user

Administrator: Responsible for setting up the system, managing user accounts, and viewing overall compliance reports.

Employee: Can view their own certification status, upload new certificates, and receive personal renewal notifications.
